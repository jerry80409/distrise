* [x] Provide a websockets (ws://localhost:8080/relay)
* [x] Support the following types of messages:

## QuickStart
Run up the Cockroach database and the RabbitMQ.

Run up the Spring boot
```shell

./gradlew :nostr-gateway:bootRun 
```

## Q&A
### Why did I choose this database?
I would choose the Cockroach database, because is a open source distribute database, supported data sharding 
capabilities, and I think I'm not really sure about the partitioning and sharding, so the first I will consider 
sharding the data using time slicing, such as creating a table for events in the same month/years?! 

### If the number of events to be stored will be huge, what would you do to scale the database?
The Cockroach database has [Multi-Region Capabilities](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/dev/multiregion-overview.html), I consider that because the Relay Events stored in a regional 
have several benefit,
1. Horizontal expansion.
2. Reduced the network latency.
3. Enhanced High available and Disaster Recovery.
